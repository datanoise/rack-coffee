# rack-coffee

Simple rack middleware for serving up [CoffeeScript][coffee] files as compiled
javascript.

## Usage

The options behave similarly to Rack::Static:

    require 'rack/coffee'
    use Rack::Coffee,
        :root => '/path/to/directory/above/url',
        :urls => '/javascipts'

For rails, presuming you've required 'rack/coffee' somehow, stick this in the
Rails initializer config block:

    config.middleware.use Rack::Coffee, :root => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/public"

Note however that by default this will not play nicely with
`javascript_include_tag`'s `:cache` option, you would need to compile your
.coffee files before deploying. Alternately, check out the
[BistroCar][bistrocar] rails plugin that plays nicely with rails asset handling.

## Options

* `:root`: the directory above `urls`. Defaults to `Dir.pwd`.
* `:urls`: the directories in which to look for coffeescripts. May specify
  a string or an array of strings. Defaults to `/javascripts`.
* `:cache`: Sets a `Cache-Control` header if truthy, `public` if set to
  `:public`
* `:ttl`: The default `max-age` value for the `Cache-Control` header. Defaults
  to `86400`.
* `:bare`: When `true`, disables the top-level function wrapper that
  CoffeeScript uses by default.
* `:join`: Set to a string, f.e. "index" to concat all the .coffee files before
  compiling

## Bugs?

* Let me know here: [Issue Tracking][issues]

## Requirements

* [CoffeeScript Gem][coffee-gem] and therefore [execjs][]
* [Rack][rack]

## Thanks

* Jeremy Ashkenas, for creating CoffeeScript
* Brian Mitchell, for picking up the slack on handling the 0.5 update

## History

* March 18, 2012:
    This release is **NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE** with 0.9.x.
    * **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY** remove `:static` option. If you want to
      serve stock javascript files from the same directory as your coffeescript
      files, stick a Rack::File in your middleware stack after Rack::Coffee.
    * **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY** remove `:nowrap` option in favor of `:bare`
    * Use `execjs` gem instead of coffee-script command. Thanks to [jewel][] for
      kicking this off, even if I didn't use their code.

* May 5, 2011: release 0.9.1
    * Fix a bug in the 'join' option to reflect how command-line -p actually
      works

* May 3, 2011: release 0.9
    * Make '304 NOT MODIFIED' return a correct response body on Ruby 1.9
      [Aanand Prasad][aanand]
    * Added 'join' option for concating your js

* January 21, 2011: release 0.3.3
    Two changes by [Jonathan Baudanza][jbaudanza]:
    * changed --nowrap to --bare, per a recent change to coffee-script. You may
      use :nowrap or :bare to indicate you want this
    * return 304 NOT MODIFIED for caching purposes

* March 21, 2010: release 0.3.2
    * added :nowrap option to config, allowing the disabling of the top-level
      function wrapper.

* March 6, 2010: release 0.3.1
    * options now take :cache and :ttl options for setting cache headers, should
      you decide to actually serve up hot coffeescripts outside of your
      development environment. Via Brian Mitchell. 

* March 6, 2010: release 0.3 REQUIRES COFFEE-SCRIPT 0.5 OR HIGHER
    * CoffeeScript is now written in coffeescript. The included compiler is now
      based on node.js instead of being hosted in a ruby gem, so we're shelling
      out to the command-line interpreter. Thanks to [Brian Mitchell][binary42]
      for doing most of the dirty work, at least as far as ruby 1.9 is
      concerned.

* January 27, 2010: release 0.2 BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE
    * replace :url parameter in favor of :urls, now it behaves similarly to
      Rack::Static (Brian Mitchell)
    * add :static parameter, which when false will disable automatic asset
      serving of url misses via Rack::File, instead passing through to the app.
    * improve documentation for Rails
    * remove dependency on Pathname, oh if only it were stdlib instead of extlib

* January 26, 2010: First public release 0.1.
